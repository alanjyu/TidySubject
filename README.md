# TidySubject

A lightweight [Thunderbird](https://www.thunderbird.net/) extension that automatically removes outdated external tags like [EXT], [Extern], and collapses repetitive prefixes such as Re, Aw, and Fwd. User-configurable.

e.g., **Fwd: Re: [EXT] Aw: [Extern] Re: [External]** $\rightarrow$ **Fwd: Re*3** (collapsed) or **Fwd:** (overwritten).

## Installation

In Thunderbird, go to *Settings* (the gear icon on bottom left), *Add-ons and themes*, and search *TidySubject* in *Find more add-ons*. Alternatively, install directly from [here](https://addons.thunderbird.net/addon/tidysubject/).
